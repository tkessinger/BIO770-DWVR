# Outline for today

0. Caveats: I'm an R newbie too! Mostly. Sorta?
1. Go over syllabus
2. Install R and RStudio
3. What is R?
4. What are Markdown and R Markdown?

# Syllabus

- The syllabus will be located here: <https://github.com/vancleve/BIO770-DWVR>. 
- This is also where R and R Markdown documents will be located. The only files that will be kept on the [Canvas site](https://uk.instructure.com/courses/1843807) are the PDF copies of the reference books and the completed labs and figures that you submit.
- I'll update the syllabus and schedule of topics as necessary.

# Install R and RStudio

## Downloading

If you haven't already, download R and R studio

- To download R, go here: <https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/>
- To download RStudio, go here <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>
    - Note: this is the "preview version", which is preferable. The "preview version" includes something called an "R Notebook", which is basically a more interactive way to use R Markdown. I'll be using this during the class.

## Installing

If you need directions, especially for how update your packages if you already have R, go here:
<http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html>

Otherwise, proceed with your installing normal if you haven't already.

## Running RStudio

### What is RStudio?

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the R progamming language. While you can write R code in any text editor you like and then run that code with the R interpreter, there are many things that an IDE can do that help you be more efficient when programming.

1. Synatx highlighting (e.g., see the markdow!)
2. File/project organization (see "Files" pane)
3. Examining variables that you've set (see the "Environment" pane)
4. Easily execute code and examine its text output (see "Console") or graphical output (see "Viewer")
5. View help files (see "Help")
6. Installing/updating R packages (see "Tools" menu)
7. Debugging (see "Debug" menu)

When using RStudio, I encourage you to:

1. Play around with different arrangements for the windows/panes
2. **LEARN KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS**. They can make you much, much more efficient.
    - Shift+Alt+K (MAC/PC):  Keyboard shortcut quick reference.
    - Shift+Command/Control+K (MAC/PC): Knit current document (i.e., turn in HTML/DOCX/PDF)
    - Command/Control+Enter (MAC/PC): Run selected lines
    - Shift+Command/Control+Enter: Run current "chunk" (R Notebook only)
    - etc

For example, to generate 10 random numbers between 0 and 1 we can easily run the following code:
 
```{r}
runif(10)
```

To make sure you can do run the above, you want to run the folowing code that installs R Markdown:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## What is R?

### First, there was "S". 

- S was designed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs in the 1970s specifically for data analysis and statistics.
- R was developed in 1991 by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman and reimplemented much of S after S became licensed software.

### Then there was "R"

- R was open-sourced in 1995 and John Chambers and other statisticians are part of its core development team.
- R is object-oriented (i.e., you can build containers of variables and the like), like Java.
- R is interpreted (i.e., the interpreter turns interprets your text code immediately and runs it), like Python.
- R has a tonne of packages for statistics and biology.
- More on the basics of R next time.

# What are Markdown and R Markdown?

## Markdown: a plain text (i.e., just characters) way of "formatting" text

- Markdown is a kind of "markup" language (e.g., HTML).
- Designed for simplicity and readability
- No need to "view" Markdown to read it easily
- Often used in code documentation
- Increasingly used in full document prepartion (journal article, books, etc)

Ok, let's get Markdown!

![](assets/dancing.gif)

First, this whole document is R Markdown, so you can quickly see examples of the following:

- Headings are created with hash symbols "#"
    - "#" is the "first" heading
    - "##" is the "second" heading, which is smaller (how much smaller? set by the "stylesheet")
    - etc
- *Italic text* in encapsulated by one \* or asterisk, **Bold text** by two asterisks.
- Lists can start with \-, \*, or \+.
    - Sublists are indented with four spaces.
- New paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

    Line breaks, without a new paragraph, need two spaces  
    in order to be recognized. These can be used in lists too.
- Links use angle brackets \<\>: <https://www.r-project.org/>
- Links with different text use `[text](http://link.to.something)`
- Images use `![](path.to.image)`
- For more details, see [R Markdown cheat sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)


## R Markdown: a way to mix text (Markdown) and R code (R)

Ok, lets put some R in this thing.

Make a code "**chunk**"" with three back ticks followed by an r in braces. End the chunk with three back ticks:

```{r}
paste("Hello", "World!")
```

Place code inline with a single back ticks. The first back tick must be followed by an R, like this: `r paste("Hello", "World!")`.

You can control how the **chunks** work by adding options like `echo=FALSE` to hide the code when you create the HTML

```{r echo=TRUE}
runif(10)
```

You can do plots too. Let's do one whose "name" is "cool_plot" and is just a bunch (1000) of normally distributed numbers (mean=0, std=1):

```{r cool_plot, echo=TRUE}
plot(rnorm(1000, 0, 1))
```

More about R Markdown can be found in the [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).
