# Obejcts are functions and functions are objects

Everything in R is either a function or an object (actually functions are objects too!). For example numbers are objects,
```{r}
a_number = 10
```
strings of characters, AKA "strings", are objects,
```{r}
a_string = "hello world\n"
```
and even functions, like `print`, which prints a string, is an object,
```{r}
a_function = print
a_function("hello world")
```
What is an object then? It is just something stored in memory with a name.

# Statements and style

## Assignment statements

To create an object, you perform an "assignment statement" where the name of the object is on the left, the value of the object is on the right, and in the middle is the assignment operator, "=",
```{r}
an_object = "a string object"
```
or "<-"
```{r}
an_object <- "a string object"
```
Either "<-" or "=" works as the assignment operator though most R aficionados will use "<-". However, I prefer (strongly) the "=" operator since that's what almost **every other language** uses. No R, you're not that special.

## Style of statements

- Every command in R must end in a "newline" or semicolon. Newlines are the norm in most R code and I will use them too.
- If an R statement is incomplete and you enter a newline, R will let you continue the statement: 
```{r}
new_statement = print("this continues on the
next line")
```
- Use plenty of space in your statements to help readability.
- This is more readable
```{r}
a = (100 + 3) - 2
mean( c( a / 100, 642564624.34 ) )
```
- than this
```{r}
a=(100+3)-2
mean(c(a/100,642564624.34))
```
- Use "tabs" to set off blocks of code like loops and function definition. Good coding style will make these blocks look obvious since they are indented and spaced nicely. This makes understanding which parts of the code are run when much easier.

## Naming conventions

Now that you can create objects using statements, you have to know how to name them. R has some simple rules for this:

> A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as ".2way" are not valid, and neither are the reserved words

This information comes from the help for the `make.names` command, which you can get type typing `?makes.names` where "?" before a function gives you the help page:
```{r}
?make.names
```
Then, you convert any string into a valid R variable name using the `make.names` command:
```{r}
not_valid_name = "1 way to not be a valid name"
valid_name = make.names(not_valid_name)
print(valid_name)
```

A couple tips for naming objects:

- Err on the side of using longer object names that describe what that object stores: e.g., `populationSize` is often better than `N`. Note that R itself doesn't always obey this rule; e.g., the function `c` combines values. **Never** name a function a single letter.
- Maintain a convention for using multiple words in object names. E.g., underscores or periods for spaces or capitalize every word
- Remember that R is case sensitive, so `populationSize` is a different object from `populationsize`.
- Don't use object names that differ only case; this will almost certainly lead to user created bugs.

# Types of objects

## Scalars

Scalars are the simplest object in R. They hold a single value like a number (called "numeric" by R) or a string (called "character" by R)
```{r}
number = 3.1459
string = "hello again world"
```
How do you know these objects are the types you think they are? You can check with the function `class`:
```{r}
class(number)
class(string)
```
You can ask for a little more by getting the "structure" of the object using the function `str` (by the way, this function is another example of a name that is too short; strike two R).
```{r}
str(number)
str(string)
```
These commands may not be super useful now, but R has enough different types of object that you'll want to be able to ask an object about itself at some point.

## Vectors

Vectors are everywhere in R. They are simply lists of objects of a common type, like numeric or character. Actually our scalars were just vectors with a single element. To create a vector, use the poorly named `c` or combine function.
```{r}
number_vector = c(1,10,100,1000)
number_vector
string_vector = c("hello", "world", "for", "yet", "another", "time")
string_vector
```
To find out the length of the vectors you just created, use the function `length`
```{r}
length(number_vector)
length(string_vector)
```

Accessing elements of a vector is accomplishing using "indexing". Vectors are index from 1 to the number of elements in the vector. To access an element, use braces after the object name; printing the second element of `string_vector` looks like this:
```{r}
print(string_vector[2])
```

## Lists

Suppose that you want a vector that mixes numbers and strings. You could try
```{r}
mixed = c(1,2,3,"one","two","three")
```
but looking at the result
```{r}
mixed
```
you will find that R converted the numbers to strings. That's because vectors only contain a single object type.

Lists however can contain multiple types. Thus, using the `list` function works:
```{r}
mixed = list(1,2,3,"one","two","three")
str(mixed)
```

# Flow control and logical tests

Flow control is a technical term for telling a program which statements or blocks of code to execute. In R, you use "if-else" statements to accomplish this. For example, you can print a statement only if a variable takes a certain value:
```{r}
test = -10
if (test > 0) {
  print("test is greater than zero")
} else {
  print ("test is not greater than zero")
}
```
The brackets enclose the block of statements that get executed if the condition is true or not. Note that the else is on the same line as the final bracket of the "if". The ">" (greater than) symbol is an example of a *relational operator*; others include equals, "==", not equals, "!=", and "greater than or equal", ">=" (likewise, less than operators exist too).

The outcome of a comparison with a relational operator is a "TRUE" or "FALSE" value, which are "Booleans". You can combine TRUE and FALSE values with *Boolean operators* like "and", "&&", "or", "||", and "not", "!". For example, you can check our whether our test variable is greater than zero or less than -1:
```{r}
test = -10
if (test > 0 || test < -1) {
  print("test is greater than zero or less than -1")
} else {
  print ("test is between zero and -1")
}
```

# Loops

Loops are ways to tell R to perform a block of commands repeatedly. The most useful kind of loop is the "for" loop. First, you create an empty vector. Then, you use the for loop to fill its elements.
```{r}
vec = c()
for (i in 1:100) {
  vec[i] = i*i
}
str(vec) 
```
The structure of the for loop is `for (index.object in index.value) { code block }`. The first run of the loop sets `index.object` to the first element of `index.value` and executes the code block. The next run sets the `index.object` to the second value of `index.value`, executes the code block, and so on until the loop has run as many times as there are elements in `index.value`.

Note that the above loops shows you something else about vectors. You can build them dynamically by just assigning values to their elements. This is a very convenient thing that R lets you do, but many other languages will not (and sometimes for good reasons). 

# More on functions

Functions are important so we will discuss them in more detail. Functions take "arguments" between the parentheses and these arguments are the data you want the function to use. For example, the `runif` generates uniformly distributed random numbers. There are three arguments to the function:
```{r}
str(runif)
```
The first argument is how many numbers we want, the second is the minimum value for them, and the third is the maximum value. Thus, to create 10 random numbers between -1 and 1, you do this:
```{r}
print(runif(10, -1, 1))
```

In RStudio, a handy way to see what functions are available or to jog your memory about a function's name is to begin typing the name and then hit "tab" when you have a few characters. RStudio will show you a list of possible functions and if you hit "tab" again it will complete your typing with the highlighted name. If you're typing inside the parenthesis, hitting "tab" will help remind you what the arguments to the function are.

In R, the arguments to functions often have "names". If they do, you can give the argument with it's name:
```{r}
print(runif(min = -1, max = 1, n = 10))
```
Notice that giving the name of the argument allows us to give the arguments in any order. If an arguments doesn't have a name, then you must give the arguments in the order they are listed in the definition of the function (see the function help with "?function_name").

One of the most powerful parts of programming in any language is writing your own functions. To do this, you start with a name for the function and assign the object to `function(arg1, arg2, ...) { function body }`. For example, the function
```{r}
runit = function(n = 1) {
  return(runif(n, max = 1, min = 0))
}
```
generates a random number in the unit interval (0,1) where the number of values you want is the only argument. We can exclude that argument since it has a "default" value of 1 or give the argument explicitly, with or without a name:
```{r}
print(runit())
print(runit(n = 2))
print(runit(5))
```
Finally, the function returns whatever is in the "return" function or the last value in the function body. Thus, we can easily capture our random numbers or the output from any function:
```{r}
rvals = runit(5)
print(rvals)
```

# Lab ![](assets/beaker.png)

#### Write a function that plots a date slice of congressional polling data

1. Use the following code to import the data analysis libraries and the voter polling data from <https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/>. We'll select out the "Voter" subgroup since its most relevant (and some of the other data is odd, which you can see by plotting all of it).

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

congress = read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/generic-ballot-data/generic_topline.csv")
congress$date = mdy(congress$modeldate)
voters = filter(congress, subgroup=="Voters")
```

2. Try plotting the data `voters`

```{r}
plot(voters$date, voters$dem_estimate)
```

3. Write a function that has the following three arguments and plots the `voters` data between two dates:
    (i) the data you want to plot
    (ii) a beginning date
    (iii) an ending date
 
4. This function should plot the data **only** between the beginning and ending date. Thanks to the `lubridate` and `dplyr` packages, this isn't too hard. You can use the following code to get a "slice" of the date between two dates (e.g., "2018-01-01" and "2018-08-01"):
```{r}
my_slice = filter(voters, date > "2018-01-01" & date < "2018-08-01")
```
  Plotting this slice shows that it works.
```{r}
plot(my_slice$date, my_slice$dem_estimate)
```

This is the kind of plot that your function should produce when you run it. That is, if you run `my_function(voters, "2018-01-01", "2018-08-01")`, you will get the above plot.

# Preview

Once we get some more plotting and slicing under our belts, we'll be able to make the graph fancier so that it looks much closer to the [FiveThirtyEight](<https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/>) version.
```{r, message=FALSE}
congress = read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/generic-ballot-data/generic_topline.csv")
congress$date = mdy(congress$modeldate)
ggplot(data=filter(congress, subgroup=="Voters"), aes(x=date)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=dem_lo, ymax=dem_hi), fill = "#008fd5", alpha=0.15) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=dem_estimate), color="#008fd5") + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=rep_lo, ymax=rep_hi), fill = "#ff2700", alpha=0.15) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=rep_estimate), color="#ff2700") + 
  ylim(20,60) + theme_bw()
```
